*This project implements a broadcast encryption with small ciphertext.

*An immplementation of paper:Adaptive Security in Broadcast Encryption Systems (with Short Ciphertexts).

*Need jar packages: jpbc-api-2.0.0.jar, jpbc-crypto-2.0.0.jar and jpbc-plaf-2.0.0.jar.

*Cannot encrypt a text message directly, but you can use the random private key K generated by broadcast encryption as the private key 
*of symmetric encryption or other encryption algorithm to encrypt a text message.
